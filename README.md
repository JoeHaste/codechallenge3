# codechallenge3

This is a mini-web application coding challenge given out by Moringa school.

It was mean't to test us on all that we have learnt so far on HTML,CSS and JavaScript

The main thing being tested was the ability to be able to communicate with the server and manipulate the DOM

The assignement was succesfully done and faced no major challenges except for PATCH and DELETE request hich kept bringing error 404 no matter what I tried
